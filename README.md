# Firebase Studio

a simple website for "KEAKEO TRADING AND PROJECTS (Pty) Ltd," a business that helps with various tender administration and quantity surveying services.

A well-structured website is key to making it easy for visitors to find the information they need. Based on the services listed in the brochure, here's a logical structure for the website:

Website Structure Overview

We'll use a few main pages to organize the content. This will make it simple to navigate and understand the company's offerings.

Home Page: This will be the landing page. It should provide a brief introduction to the company and its purpose. We can highlight the key services to grab the visitor's attention and guide them to other parts of the site.

Services Page: This page will be dedicated to explaining each of the services in detail. We'll list each of the 13 services from the brochure (like "Company Registration," "CSD Report," etc.) and provide a short description for each one.

About Us Page: This is where we'll tell the company's story. We can include information about the company's mission, values, and what makes them a good choice for their clients.

Contact Page: This is a crucial page for any business. It will contain all the contact information listed in the brochure (email addresses, phone number) and maybe a simple contact form.
